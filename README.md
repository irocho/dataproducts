# Coursera: Developing Data Products

This is my project to Developing Data Products.

It has two parts:

* Shiny (inside the directory named drill are ui.R and server.R)

* Slidify (a plot is embbeded from the R code and it has a quiz)

As I am working as a teacher I have decided to create an app and a presentation to be used with my students. 

This is just a skeleton to go on working: new formulas, new concepts and ideas, new questions in the quiz, of course some pictures...
